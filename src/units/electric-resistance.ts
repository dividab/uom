 * The derived unit for electric resistance ( <code>Î©</code> or <code>Ohm</code> ).
 * One Ohm is equal to the resistance of a conductor in which a current of one ampere is produced
 * by a potential of one volt across its terminals.
 * It is named after the German physicist Georg Simon Ohm (1789-1854).
